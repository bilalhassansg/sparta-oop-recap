## About
# In this lesson, I have been asked to recap on OOP. As a group, we have created 4 ruby files. Two of which come from 2 folders, and the other 2 are their own files with no folder.

## mammals.rb
# In this file, we have created the Mammal module and had the classes of biped and quadraped for methods.
